# neomouse

A keyboard-driven mouse control daemon for macOS, inspired by [warpd](https://github.com/rvaiya/warpd) but built around true Vim motions.

The goal is to feel like you never left Vim — mouse control that maps naturally to muscle memory.

## How it works

`neomouse` is a SwiftUI macOS app that installs a global event monitor to intercept keyboard events and translate Vim motions into mouse movements and gestures. It lives in the menu bar (no Dock icon) and runs in the background.

The codebase is a multi-target SwiftPM package: a thin `neomouse` executable that owns the app shell, plus four libraries — `neomouseUtils` (input / screen / pasteboard / gesture helpers, each grouped into a `Mouse` / `Screen` / `Pasteboard` / `Gesture` namespace), `neomouseDB` ([GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift)-backed sessions, marks, registers, macros, jumps, and executed-operation store), `neomouseConfig` ([TOMLDecoder](https://github.com/dduan/TOMLDecoder)-backed runtime configuration), and `neomouseTypes` (shared value types). Runtime tuning lives in `settings.toml`, validated against `schema/settings.schema.json`.

## Requirements

- **macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later** — visual-mode screen capture uses `ScreenCaptureKit`, which raises the floor from macOS 13 to 14.
- **Apple Silicon (arm64).** Intel Macs are not yet supported.
- **Accessibility permissions** — granted on first run. macOS prompts you; allow `neomouse` in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**, then relaunch.

The release binary is ad-hoc signed (not Apple Developer ID signed). The Homebrew and Nix install paths handle this transparently; the manual-download path needs one extra command to clear the Gatekeeper quarantine — see below.

## Install

Pick one. All three install the same v0.0.0 binary from the [Releases page](https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases).

### 1. Homebrew

```sh
brew tap KangaZero/neomouse
brew install neomouse
```

Then run:

```sh
neomouse
```

Update later with `brew upgrade neomouse`. Uninstall with `brew uninstall neomouse && brew untap KangaZero/neomouse`.

> If your Homebrew is managed declaratively by [`nix-homebrew`](https://github.com/zhaofengli/nix-homebrew), add `github:KangaZero/homebrew-neomouse` as a flake input and put `"neomouse"` in your `homebrew.brews` list. (`brew tap` will not work on a Nix-managed `/opt/homebrew`.)

### 2. Nix

Apple Silicon only. Requires Nix with [flakes enabled](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes_temporarily) (`experimental-features = nix-command flakes` in `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`).

**Try it once without installing anything:**

```sh
nix run github:KangaZero/neomouse
```

This downloads the prebuilt binary into your Nix store, runs it, and leaves no trace on next garbage collection.

**Install into your user profile** (puts `neomouse` on your `PATH` permanently):

```sh
nix profile add github:KangaZero/neomouse
```

> On Nix older than 2.20, the subcommand is `nix profile install` instead of `add`. Both still work in recent versions, but `install` is now a deprecated alias.

Update later with `nix profile upgrade neomouse`, or `nix profile upgrade --all`. Remove with `nix profile remove neomouse`.

**Add to your system flake** (recommended if you use `nix-darwin`, NixOS, or `home-manager`):

```nix
# In your existing flake.nix, add the input:
{
  inputs.neomouse = {
    url = "github:KangaZero/neomouse";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, neomouse, ... }: {
    # ...your existing config...
  };
}
```

Then reference the package wherever you list packages — e.g. inside your nix-darwin module:

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  neomouse.packages.aarch64-darwin.default
];
```

…or inside home-manager:

```nix
home.packages = [
  neomouse.packages.aarch64-darwin.default
];
```

Rebuild your system (`darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#<host>` or `home-manager switch --flake .#<user>`). Pick up new releases with `nix flake update neomouse` and rebuild.

### 3. Manual (download a tarball)

```sh
# Pick the latest release URL from https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases
VERSION=v0.0.0
curl -LO "https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases/download/${VERSION}/neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-arm64.tar.gz"
curl -LO "https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse/releases/download/${VERSION}/neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-arm64.tar.gz.sha256"

# Verify the download
shasum -a 256 -c "neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-arm64.tar.gz.sha256"

# Extract
tar -xzf "neomouse-${VERSION}-macos-arm64.tar.gz"

# Clear macOS download quarantine (only needed on the manual path)
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ./neomouse

# Run
./neomouse

# Optional: put it on your PATH
sudo install -m 755 ./neomouse /usr/local/bin/neomouse
```

## Development

Requires Swift 6.3+ (`swift --version`). No Xcode required for building — Command Line Tools is enough. [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) is the front door for every common task; underlying `swift` commands are documented below if you'd rather invoke them directly.

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KangaZero/neomouse
cd neomouse

# One-time per clone: enable the repo's git hooks
scripts/setup-hooks.sh
```

The repo pins its dev tooling — `swift`, `just`, and `taplo` — in `mise.toml`, so it stays out of your global environment. If you use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (recommended; install with `brew install mise` or `curl https://mise.run | sh`):

```sh
mise trust   # one-time, allow this repo's mise.toml to run
mise install # fetches the pinned versions
```

mise installs each tool into `~/.local/share/mise/installs/<tool>/<version>/` and only adds them to `PATH` while you're inside this repo (via the shell hook). Outside the repo, none of them are available.

> The swift pin matters: macOS's Command Line Tools toolchain ships `Testing.framework` without the `_TestingInterop` C bridge that `swift-testing` 6.3 hard-links. The swift.org toolchain (what mise installs) ships both, so `swift test` works without any rpath gymnastics. Full Xcode also works.

If you don't use mise, install `swift` from [swift.org](https://www.swift.org/install/), and `just` / `taplo` however you prefer (`brew install just taplo`, etc.).

`setup-hooks.sh` sets `core.hooksPath=.githooks`. The pre-commit hook runs `swift format lint --strict` on staged Swift files and `swift test` before each commit. The same checks run in CI on every push to `main` and every PR.

### `just` — the catch-all

```sh
just               # list every recipe with a one-line description
just all           # catch-all: lint + test + release build (what CI runs)
```

Other recipes:

| Recipe | Does |
|---|---|
| `just build` | Debug build → `.build/debug/neomouse` |
| `just release` | Release build → `.build/release/neomouse` |
| `just run` | Build and run the debug binary |
| `just run-release` | Build and run the release binary |
| `just test` | Run the test suite (`swift test`) |
| `just lint` | `swift format lint --strict` on `Sources/` and `Tests/` |
| `just fmt` | `swift format -i` to auto-format in place |
| `just check-config` | Validate `settings.toml` against `schema/settings.schema.json` (Taplo) |
| `just check` | `lint + test + check-config` (what the pre-commit hook runs) |
| `just clean` | `swift package clean` and remove `.build/` |

macOS will prompt for Accessibility permissions the first time you launch from each build path. Allow `neomouse` in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**, then relaunch.

### Underlying commands

The justfile is a thin wrapper. If you want to run things by hand:

```sh
swift build                  # debug build
swift build -c release       # release build
swift run                    # build + run debug
swift run -c release         # build + run release
swift test                   # run the test suite
```

`swift test` uses [swift-testing](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-testing) (`import Testing`). With the mise-pinned swift.org toolchain (or full Xcode), it Just Works — both `Testing` and `_TestingInterop` ship in the toolchain. If you're stuck on a Command Line Tools-only install, `_TestingInterop` is missing and the link step will fail; install full Xcode or use the mise pin above.

### Configuration

Runtime tuning is in `settings.toml`. `Config.loadConfig` is called once at app start; properties on `NeoMouseState` fall back to inline defaults when no settings file is resolved. Resolution order (first match wins):

1. `$NEOMOUSE_CONFIG`
2. `~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml`
3. `~/Library/Application Support/neomouse/settings.toml`

The repo-root `settings.toml` is a **template**, not auto-loaded. For local dev, either symlink it (`ln -s "$(pwd)/settings.toml" ~/.config/neomouse/settings.toml`) or `export NEOMOUSE_CONFIG="$(pwd)/settings.toml"`.

`just check-config` runs Taplo against `schema/settings.schema.json` so schema drift is caught at commit time, not at startup.

### Dev seed

The DB starts with a single seed session ("Cookiezi"). To reinitialise from scratch with extra sessions and randomly-placed marks (useful when exercising mark UX), set `NEOMOUSE_SEED=1`:

```sh
NEOMOUSE_SEED=1 swift run
```

This **wipes and re-creates every table** (`forceReIntialize: true`), then runs `seedAll(sessionCount: 3, marksPerSession: 5, registersPerSession: 3)` — extra sessions, randomly-placed marks, and registers `a`–`c` populated with sample `NSPasteboardItem`s. Do not set this on a database you care about.

### Debug logging

`debug(...)` in `Sources/neomouseUtils/dev/debug.swift` writes to two independent sinks: **stdout** and **a log file**. Each is gated separately.

**Stdout** is enabled when either:

- The binary was built in debug configuration (`swift build` / `swift run`), so `#if DEBUG` is set automatically, **or**
- The runtime env var `DEBUG` is set to a non-empty, non-falsy value (anything except `0` / `false`).

```sh
DEBUG=1 neomouse              # installed via brew/nix
DEBUG=1 swift run -c release  # locally built release binary
```

Debug builds always print to stdout regardless of the env var.

**File logging** is enabled when:

- The env var `LOG` is set to a non-empty, non-falsy value.
- `LOG_LOCATION` (optional) sets the destination. Default: `/tmp/neomouse/logs/neomouse.log`.
  - If `LOG_LOCATION` ends in `.log`, it's treated as a full file path.
  - Otherwise it's treated as a directory and `neomouse.log` is appended.
  - The parent directory is created if missing. The file is opened append-only.

```sh
LOG=1 neomouse                                         # → /tmp/neomouse/logs/neomouse.log
LOG=1 LOG_LOCATION=~/Library/Logs/neomouse neomouse    # → ~/Library/Logs/neomouse/neomouse.log
LOG=1 LOG_LOCATION=/tmp/x.log neomouse                 # → /tmp/x.log
DEBUG=1 LOG=1 neomouse                                 # both stdout and file
```

The env-var checks are evaluated once at module load, so per-`debug()` overhead is a `Bool` check plus formatting. File writes are serialized on a background queue.

### Lint / format config

`.swift-format` at the repo root: 4-space indent, 120-line limit, `NoAssignmentInExpressions` disabled (the codebase intentionally uses `return state = ...`).
